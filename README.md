# algebra-for-gametime

Everyday my kids would pester me for game time, until one day they came home with a failed math test on inequality algebra. So I created this little webapp, so that they need to earn every 15 minutes of game time by doing a quiz. Here's the deployed version: https://algebra-for-gametime.web.app/.

The quiz will generate 5 questions by default. You can change the number of questions by adding an URL parameter: https://algebra-for-gametime.web.app/?leng=x

## Dependency

It uses an excellent library https://algebra.js.org/.
