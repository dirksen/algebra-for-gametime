# algebra-for-gametime

Everyday my kids would pester me for game time, until one day they came home with a failed math test on inequality algebra. So I created this little webapp, so that they need to earn every 15 minutes of game time by doing a quiz. Here's the deployed version: https://algebra-for-gametime.web.app/.

The quiz will generate 5 questions by default. You can change the number of questions by adding an URL parameter: https://algebra-for-gametime.web.app/?leng=x

## How to verify the result

At the end of the game, the kids will enter their parents phone number, and the result will be sent to the parents via SMS text for review.
